The urgence of mitigating climate change in this century rely on alternative energy sources, including unlimited renewable sources of wind and solar. In a cloudless day, half of the Earth's sphere is exposed to sunlight, the energy source coming from the Sun. This radiance can be converted to electricity by photovoltaic cells which are manufactured as commercial sonal panels. In the past ten years, average prices of solar panels have drastically been reduced from $7.34 in 2010 to $2.34 in 2020 which demonstrates a strong prospect for solar energy ([see the report of IEA in 2020](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2020?mode=overview)). Their prediction on total installed wind and solar PV capacity is oncourse to surpass natural gas in 2023 and coal 2024. Solar PV alone accounts for 60% of all renewable capacity additions through 2025, and wind provides another 30%. By 2025 renewables will overtake coal to become the largest csource of electricity generation worldwide. Behind these projection is the net-zero emission targets, the main driving factors to boost the growth. 

Earth's atmospheric has made solar radiance and wind two complement energy sources: where solar energy remains strong in tropical areas, wind is not that powerful, and vice versa in higher altitude regions. This nature of the renewable energy also make it electricity produced from them are more intermittent: depending on weather and local micro-atmospheric conditions.
