I am a senior research scientist at Winnow Solutions, a London-based startup pioneering on reducing food waste using Artificial Intelligence for Good. Since 2017, I have helped designing one of the first smart bins that categorizes food waste into different kinds, our Winnow Vision products have been used on different continents in the world.

I am also an entrepreneur, a co-founder and CTO of a funded startup [Kubesee Ltd.](https://www.kubesee.com/), based in London, whose mission is to provide insurance solutions for arable lands. Our products include index insurances that predict crop yields from multi-spectral satellite images, weather and soil data, to provide a timely forecast of yield loss at national scale.

Phong Vo is a postdoctoral engineer working at [Vision & Content Engineering Lab](http://www.kalisteo.eu/en/index.htm) [CEA LIST](http://www-list.cea.fr/index.php/en/) since April 2014. His responsibility in the team is to train deep convolutional networks under unsupervised and semi-supervised settings in order to build image representation with good generalization. Prior coming to deep learning, he had a good time with kernel and manifold learning during his PhD, which was supervised by Dr. [Hichem Sahbi](http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~sahbi/) at [TELECOM ParisTech](http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/).

Phong Vo graduated CS Bachelor in 2007 and CS Master in 2009 at [University of Science](http://www.hcmus.edu.vn/en/index.php). He also had an internship at [National Institute of Information](http://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), working on video event detection under the supervision of Dr. [Shin'ichi Satoh](http://research.nii.ac.jp/~satoh/) and Dr. [Duy-Dinh Le](http://satoh-lab.ex.nii.ac.jp/users/ledduy/).
