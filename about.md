I am a postdoctoral engineer working at [CEA LIST]() since April 2014. Nowadays at the time of Cambrian explosion of deep learning, I work on deep convolutional networks to improve image representation in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. One of those is the problem of how to train deep models from an abundant amount of weakly labeled and noisy data. Such a problem still remains a long-term goal of machine learning community. Before working on deep learning, I had a fun time with transductive kernel methods during my PhD time, under the supervision of Dr. Hichem Sahbi, in the group [TII](http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~bloch/tii/), [TSI department](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/), [TELECOM ParisTech](http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/).

Before moving to France, I finished my CS Bachelor in 2007 and CS Master in 2009 at [University of Science, Vietnam](http://www.hcmus.edu.vn/en/index.php). Also in 2009, I had an internship at  the [National Institute of Information](http://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), under the supervision of [Shin'ichi Satoh](http://research.nii.ac.jp/~satoh/) and [Duy-Dinh Le](http://satoh-lab.ex.nii.ac.jp/users/ledduy/).
