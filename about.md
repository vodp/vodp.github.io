###Some people I used to know say about me###
Phong Vo is a postdoctoral engineer working at [Vision & Content Engineering Lab](http://www.kalisteo.eu/en/index.htm) [CEA LIST](http://www-list.cea.fr/index.php/en/) since April 2014. His responsibility in the team is to train deep convolutional networks under unsupervised and semi-supervised settings in order to build image representation with good generalization. Prior coming to deep learning, he had a good time with kernel and manifold learning during his PhD, which was supervised by Dr. [Hichem Sahbi](http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~sahbi/) at [TSI department](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/), [TELECOM ParisTech](http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/).

Phong Vo graduated CS Bachelor in 2007 and CS Master in 2009 at [University of Science](http://www.hcmus.edu.vn/en/index.php). He also had an internship at [National Institute of Information](http://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), working on video event detection under the supervision of Dr. [Shin'ichi Satoh](http://research.nii.ac.jp/~satoh/) and Dr. [Duy-Dinh Le](http://satoh-lab.ex.nii.ac.jp/users/ledduy/).

###What I say about me###
Being a half-time father, I also have another part-time job as a postdoctoral engineer, starting from 9am to 6pm every weekday. Striving with artificial intelligence and deep learning, my career endeavors the bright future for my daughter, and your children too.

* 5+ experience years with machine learning and visual recognition
* PhD in Signal and Images, specialized in kernel methods
* Asians are good at maths, so do I? Maybe.
* Love coding, write and consumes it as a daily basis
* Friend with `Python`, sacred loves with `C` and `C++`, used to get along with `Matlab`, good old friend with `Java`, `HTML` and `JavaScript` are my neighbors.

### What I have done ###
* `{Deep, Kernel, Manifold} * Learning`
* `Image * {Segmentation, Annotation, Parsing, Classification, Retrieval}`

### What I do in free time ###
Dream about robots awaring of their asses, and make it move by a Raspbery Pi, Arduino, or an Android phone.
