Phong Vo is a postdoctoral engineer working in the [Vision & Content Engineering Lab](http://www.kalisteo.eu/en/index.htm) at [CEA LIST](http://www-list.cea.fr/index.php/en/) since April 2014. His responsibility in the team is to train deep convolutional networks in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings in order to build image representation with good generalization. Prior coming to deep learning, he had a good time with kernel methods during his PhD which is supervised by Dr. [Hichem Sahbi](http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~sahbi/), [TSI department](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/), [TELECOM ParisTech](http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/).

Phong graduated CS Bachelor in 2007 and CS Master in 2009 at [University of Science](http://www.hcmus.edu.vn/en/index.php). He had a half-year internship in the same year at [National Institute of Information](http://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), under the supervision of Dr. [Shin'ichi Satoh](http://research.nii.ac.jp/~satoh/) and Dr. [Duy-Dinh Le](http://satoh-lab.ex.nii.ac.jp/users/ledduy/).
