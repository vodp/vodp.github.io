## Welcome to Phong D. Vo's homepage! ##

### Short Bio ###

I am a 3rd year PhD student in the group TII (Traitement et Interprétation des Images), TSI department (UMR CNRS 5141 LTCI), TELECOM ParisTech (aslo known as ENST or École Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications). During my thesis, I participated in the project of satellite images visualization with CNES.

Before moving to France, I finished my Bachelor in 2007 and Master in 2009, at Computer Science department, University of Science, Vietnam. In mid-2009, I had an internship at  the National Institute of Information, under the supervision of Dr.Shin'ichi Satoh and Duy-Dinh Le.

### Interest ###

My research is about transductive learning and kernel methods, under the supervision of Dr. Hichem Sahbi. Particularly, my thesis' goal is to design data dependent kernel under transduction setting, i.e when labeled data are few compared to unlabeled data. Kernel learning techniques for inductive inference, henceforth, is inappropriate. We instead learn kernel map from both labeled and unlabeled data, given manifold assumption.

I am also interested in a wide range of topics, for example large-margin classification, matrix factorization, sparse coding, and applications of machine learning into computer vision. Please visit my research page and publication page (or Google Scholar page) for more details. Snippets of code can be found in research sub-sections.

Here are my CV. It is my gratitude to get contact from you.
